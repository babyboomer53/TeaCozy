    Wow!  It  took me around 40 minutes to figure out why there was a "hole"
    at the top of my browser  between the top edge of the header and the top
    edge of the browser window. It wasnÂ¿t until I scrolled the window that I
    noticed a sliver only a few pixels in height through which I  could  see
    the rest of the content peeking through as it scrolled beneath the fixed
    header. Using the DevTools, I discovered that something  was  setting  a
    margin,  and  that  the  culprit  was  the body element! Apparently, the
    infamous "user agent" stylesheet sets a default margin of 8  pixels  for
    the  body element, which was pushing the header down by a few pixels and
    creating a gap between the top of the header and the edge of the window.
    To rectify that, I coded the following override:
    */
    margin-top: 0;  /* Override the default value for the the top margin of the body element. */
    font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
    font-size: 22px;

    background: linear-gradient(to bottom, black, black, black, rgb(142, 113, 12), White);
    */

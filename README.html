<p>Codecademy BWS unit 4 day 14-16</p>
<p>When my computer crashed in the second week of the course, it took five days to get it running again. I&#39;ve been playing catch-up ever since. In response to the first project I submitted, I was encouraged to experiment. So, regarding the specifications
  as a mere suggestion, I took some &quot;liberties.&quot; Once I realized that I was not going to make the &quot;deadline,&quot; I was able to relax a bit. The problem is that I am a bit OCD. The longer I worked on it, the more things I found to work
  on.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember when I got the inspiration for the background, but I was looking for something more representative of the establishment being advertised - something reflecting the ambience. When I searched the Internet for images of crumpled paper,
  I hit the mother load! Although I tried several variations on the theme, I ended up back at my original choice. I should have trusted my instincts, but I&#39;m a little rusty. It would have saved me time and money.</p>
<p>One of the things I&#39;ve always liked in a website is the illusion that it&#39;s elements are floating above the background. That illusion is enhanced when you can make the elements move independently of the background. By default, the background moves
  when the page scrolls. I found out how to make the background stay put! To enhance the effect, I considered using a background image that was out of focus. The possibilities are endless, and this could go on forever, but eventually I would reach the
  point of diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Working on this project has given me the opportunity to become more familiar with git and GitHub. Additionally, another student introduced me to the code editor named &quot;Brackets.&quot; Wow, that has been a real boon! I signed up on CodePen as well!</p>
<p>When coding the &quot;featured tea&quot; section in the initial release of this document, I failed to implement that solution using flex‐boxes. Instead, I used table elements. My research revealed that the use of tables for this purpose is not the best
  practice. My experience was that tables are relatively unwieldy. Intent on remediating that, I opened a new branch (flex‐remediation) for this repository. The flex‐remediation branch contains a version of this project in which the tables have been replaced
  by flex‐boxes.</p>

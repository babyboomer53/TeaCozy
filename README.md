Codecademy BWS unit 4 day 14-16
When my computer crashed in the second week of the course, it took  five
days  to get it running again. I've been playing catch-up ever since. In
response  to  the  first  project  I  submitted,  I  was  encouraged  to
experiment.  So,  regarding  the  specifications as a mere suggestion, I
took some "liberties." Once I realized that I was not going to make  the
"deadline,"  I  was  able to relax a bit. The problem is that I am a bit
OCD. The longer I worked on it, the more things I found to work on.

I don't remember when I got the inspiration for the  background,  but  I
was looking for something more representative of the establishment being
advertised  -  something reflecting the ambience.  When  I  searched the
Internet for images of crumpled paper, I hit the mother load! Although I
tried several variations on the theme, I ended up back  at  my  original
choice.  I  should have trusted my instincts, but I'm a little rusty. It
would have saved me time  and money.

One of the things I've always liked in a website is  the  illusion  that
it's  elements  are  floating  above  the  background.  That illusion is
enhanced when you can  make  the  elements  move  independently  of  the
background.  By  default,  the background moves when the page scrolls. I
found out how to make the background stay put! To enhance the effect,  I
considered  using  a  background  image  that  was  out  of  focus.  The
possibilities are endless, and this could go on forever, but  eventually
I would reach the point of diminishing returns.

Working  on  this  project  has  given  me  the  opportunity become more
familiar with git and GitHub. Additionally, another  student  introduced
me  to the code editor named "Brackets." Wow, that has been a real boon!
I signed up on CodePen as well!

As invested as I am in the current project, one day  soon  I  will  look
back  at  this  as  just the first step in a journey towards bigger and
better things.
